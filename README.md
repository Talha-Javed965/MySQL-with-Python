In this project I worked with MySQL Workbench open source database named as Sakila and Python Jupyter Notebook
The Sakila database contains data related to actors, films they worked on and other data
The primary purpose of this project was to learn how to connect to a databse using python
Along with connecting a database, how to get/query data from the database
To do so, I used some of the most important and widely used SQL statements like SELECT, ORDER BY, WHERE , DROP
Also, I created a csv file, copied the data from database and stored into the csv file.
